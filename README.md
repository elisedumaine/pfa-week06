# Interactive World Builder

**PFA â€” Week 06 / Midterm project**  
**Unreal Engine 5.8 Â· Editor Utility Widget Â· Python**

Interactive World Builder is an Unreal Editor tool for quickly building a small, playable stylized forest. Instead of placing each element by hand, an artist changes a few controls, keeps a seed, and regenerates the world from one panel.

## Where the tool lives

This is **not a standalone app**. It lives inside **Unreal Engine 5.8** as an **Editor Utility Widget**. It is used while editing a level; the Third Person template is used to test the generated world in Play mode.

## What the tool does

- Generates a seeded forest world with terrain, trees, rocks, grass, flowers, lighting, sky color, and an optional Third Person player start.
- Lets the user set a world name, seed, terrain size, tree/flower/rock/grass density, lighting intensity, color palette, and whether mountains are used.
- Keeps placement intentional: trees avoid the main path and harsh terrain; rocks appear in small clusters; ground cover stays off the path.
- Rebuilds just the vegetation layer with **Refresh Plants**, rather than recreating terrain and lighting.
- Offers **Preview**, **Save Preset**, **Load Preset**, **Start Over**, **Reset**, and **Delete World** controls.
- Removes the default Third Person template scenery while a generated world is active, then restores it when the generated world is deleted.

## What works now

- A functional Editor Utility Widget exposes the forest controls and actions listed above.
- The forest generator supports deterministic seeds, density controls, a playable Third Person start, presets, preview, and safe generated-actor cleanup.
- Vegetation is regenerated separately from terrain and lighting, so an artist can revise the plant layer without rebuilding the whole scene.
- The project contains its Python scripts, enabled project settings, imported low-poly nature meshes, level, and documentation; it is small enough to clone without Git LFS.

## What does not work yet / known limits

- The polished production theme is **Forest**. Mountain, beach, and meadow are not complete, separate finished worlds yet.
- The tool is an editor workflow, not a packaged game or a runtime in-game menu.
- A PCG plugin is enabled in the project but the current iteration uses deterministic Python/editor placement rather than a finished authored PCG graph.
- Visual polish is still being iterated: the user should choose a preferred seed, test Play mode, and capture the final generated result before grading.
- After Python changes, Unreal must restart fully; otherwise it can keep an older widget callback in memory.

## Install and run

These steps are enough for a classmate to run the project from a fresh clone.

1. Install **Unreal Engine 5.8** through the Epic Games Launcher on Windows.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/elisedumaine/pfa-week06.git
   ```

3. Extract `InteractiveWorldBuilder_Project.zip` into a new folder named `InteractiveWorldBuilder`:

   ```powershell
   Expand-Archive .\InteractiveWorldBuilder_Project.zip -DestinationPath .\InteractiveWorldBuilder
   ```

4. Open `InteractiveWorldBuilder\InteractiveWorldBuilder.uproject`. If Unreal asks to rebuild or enable project plugins, accept it.
5. Let Unreal finish compiling shaders and loading the Third Person level.
6. In the top menu, select **Tools -> Open Interactive World Builder**.
7. Set a seed and the desired sliders, then click **Generate World**.
8. Use Unreal's normal **Play** button to test the built-in Third Person character in the generated level.

The archive includes the selected Kenney Nature Kit assets in `Content/WorldBuilder/Imported/Kenney`; no separate asset download is required.

If the panel has an old layout after editing the Python file, fully close every Unreal Editor window and reopen this exact project. This reloads the Editor Utility Widget callbacks.

## Design choice: depth before breadth

The first finished environment is a forest rather than four shallow themes. The seed makes a result reproducible, and the vegetation refresh keeps terrain stable while the artist iterates on density. Those choices answer the main production problem: make fast variations without creating duplicate actors or losing a playable level.

## Peer run - required before final submission

**Classmate:** _Pending peer test - add the classmate's real name before submitting._

1. _Sentence 1: What they did to install and run the tool._
2. _Sentence 2: What worked or did not work for them._
3. _Sentence 3: One suggestion or observation about the interface/world._

The peer feedback must be written by an actual classmate. Send me their name and exact three sentences after the run, and I will add them here without inventing feedback.

## Assets and credit
